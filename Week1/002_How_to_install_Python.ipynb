    "Python runs on windows, linux, mac and other environments. There are many python distributions available. However the recommended way to install python under Microsoft Windows or Linux is to use the Anaconda distribution available at [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows]. If you are installing python from elsewhwer, make sure you get at least Python *3.8* version, not 2.7. The Anaconda distribution comes with the **[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)** collection of scientific python tools as well as the iron python notebook. For developing python code without notebooks consider using **[spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)** (also included with Anaconda) or your favourite IDE under windows, mac etc (e.g. **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)** which handles both plain python programs and notebooks) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the “Anaconda” **[installer](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows)**.\n",

    "7. Choose whether to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable. I recommend not adding Anaconda to the PATH environment variable, since this can interfere with other previously installed Python version. Instead, use Anaconda software by opening Anaconda Navigator or the Anaconda Prompt from the Start Menu. If installing python for first time check the first box.\n",
